# HPBell_2024-25/RVR
This directory contains the RVR code for the 2024 Bell AVR competition season. Last year's RVR code can be found in `RVR (last year)`. <br/><br/>
Note: As far as I can tell, the code in `RVR (last year)` isn't the actual RVR code that we ended up using last year. It's probably the [terrible](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nonfunctional) code that Carter "wrote" last year. For this year's team, please try to commit frequent, <ins>functional</ins> updates to this directory.

## To do
- Wait for Bell to release the competition format
- Determine how to best score points with the RVR
- Write well-documented code that is kept up-to-date by committing to this repository
