# HPBell_2024-25/AVR
This directory contains the AVR-2024 submodule, as well as a variety of AVR test programs for the 2024 Bell AVR competition season. The AVR code itself is located in `AVR-2024`. For all intents and purposes that is where you should go for code development. These assorted test files should more or less be ignored unless you know what you're doing. <br/><br/>
To-do list & setup/usage instructions are located in [AVR-2024/README.md](AVR-2024/README.md), or come ask **Max** what your next move should be.
